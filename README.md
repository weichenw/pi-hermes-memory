# 🧠 Pi Hermes Memory

**Persistent memory + session search + secret scanning for Pi**

---

</div>

Your Pi agent normally forgets everything when you close a session. **This extension fixes that.**

- 🔍 **Search every conversation** — "what did we discuss about auth?" finds it instantly
- 🧠 **Persistent memory** — facts, preferences, corrections survive across sessions
- ⚠️ **Learns from failures** — remembers what didn't work so you don't repeat mistakes
- 🏷️ **Categorized memories** — failures, corrections, insights, conventions, and tool quirks organized for fast retrieval
- 🛡️ **Secret scanning** — API keys and tokens are blocked from being saved
- 📚 **Procedural skills** — the agent saves *how* it solved problems, not just what
- ⚡ **Background learning** — reviews every 10 turns, saves what matters
- 🔄 **Auto-consolidation** — merges entries when full, never loses data

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pi install npm:pi-hermes-memory

# Index your past sessions (one-time)
/memory-index-sessions

# Learn how to use it
/learn-memory-tool
```

## Features

| Feature | What happens |
|---|---|
| 🔍 **Session Search** | Search across all past conversations via SQLite FTS5 |
| 🧠 **Persistent Memory** | Facts, preferences, lessons saved to markdown files |
| ⚠️ **Failure Memory** | Learn from failures — stores what didn't work and why |
| 📚 **Procedural Skills** | The agent saves *how* it solved problems as reusable docs |
| ⚡ **Background Learning** | Every 10 turns (or 15 tool calls) the agent reviews and saves |
| 🔧 **Correction Detection** | When you correct the agent, it saves immediately |
| 🔄 **Auto-Consolidation** | When memory hits capacity, auto-merges instead of erroring |
| 🛡️ **Secret Scanning** | API keys, tokens, SSH keys blocked from persistence |
| 📊 **Memory Aging** | Entries carry timestamps — consolidation knows what's stale |
| 🏗️ **Two-Tier Memory** | Global + per-project memory, both searchable |
| 💾 **Extended Store** | Unlimited searchable memories beyond core 5,000-char limit |
| 🎓 **Onboarding** | `/memory-interview` pre-fills your profile on first session |
| 💤 **Zero-injection mode** | `autoInject: false` saves context tokens — search on demand instead |
| 📊 **Token counts** | `/memory-insights` and `/memory-skills` show estimated token costs |

## How It Works

### Session Lifecycle

![Session Lifecycle](docs/images/session-lifecycle.svg)

### Memory + Skills Architecture

The extension manages three types of knowledge:

| Type | What | Storage | Token cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Memory** (MEMORY.md) | Facts — env details, project conventions, tool quirks | 2,200 chars max | Fixed per session |
| **User Profile** (USER.md) | Who you are — name, preferences, communication style | 1,375 chars max | Fixed per session |
| **Skills** (skills/*.md) | Procedures — *how* to do something, reusable across sessions | Unlimited | ~3K for index, full on demand |

### Security: Content Scanning

Every write — memory and skills — passes through a scanner before being accepted. This prevents the LLM from being tricked into storing malicious content that would later be injected into the system prompt.

## Installation

```bash
pi install npm:pi-hermes-memory
```

Or install from GitHub:

```bash
pi install git:github:chandra447/pi-hermes-memory
```

Or test locally without installing:

```bash
pi -e /path/to/pi-hermes-memory/src/index.ts
```

## Two-Tier Memory Architecture

The extension stores memory at two levels:

| Tier | Location | What goes here | Injected when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Global** | `~/.pi/agent/memory/` | Facts that apply everywhere — your name, preferences, OS, tools | Always (every session) |
| **Project** | `~/.pi/agent/<project>/` | Facts scoped to one codebase — architecture decisions, API quirks, team norms | When cwd matches the project |

Both tiers are injected into the system prompt under separate `<memory-context>` blocks.

```

```

## Zero-Injection Mode

By default, memory is injected into every session's system prompt. If you prefer to save context tokens or work on varied projects, disable auto-injection:

```json
{
  "hermesMemory": {
    "autoInject": false
  }
}
```

With `autoInject: false`:
- ✅ Memory is still saved during sessions
- ✅ Background learning, correction detection, and consolidation still run
- ✅ `memory_search` and `session_search` work on demand
- ❌ Nothing is injected into the system prompt at startup
- 🧠 Startup shows: "Memory loaded · 1163 tokens on disk · Injection OFF"

## Failure Memory

The agent learns from failures, corrections, and insights — just like humans do.

### Memory Categories

| Category | What it stores | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `failure` | What didn't work and why | "Tried localStorage for tokens — XSS vulnerability" |
| `correction` | User corrections | "Use pnpm, not npm" |
| `insight` | Learnings from experience | "Auth0 SDK handles refresh tokens automatically" |
| `preference` | User preferences | "Prefers dark theme" |
| `convention` | Project conventions | "Monorepo uses turborepo" |
| `tool-quirk` | Tool-specific knowledge | "CI needs --frozen-lockfile" |

### How It Works

1. **Auto-detection**: Background review extracts failures from conversations
2. **Correction capture**: When you correct the agent, it saves what went wrong
3. **System prompt injection**: Recent failures (last 7 days) are injected at session start
4. **Searchable**: Use `memory_search("auth", category: "failure")` to find past failures

### Example

```
User: No, use pnpm not npm
Agent: [saves correction memory]

Next session:
Agent: "I remember you prefer pnpm over npm. Let me use that."
```

The agent learns from its mistakes so you don't have to repeat yourself.

Memory blocks are wrapped in `<memory-context>` XML tags with a guard note ("NOT new user input") to prevent the LLM from treating stored facts as instructions.

## Usage

Once installed, the extension works automatically. You don't need to do anything special — the agent will start saving memories and skills on its own.

### The `memory` Tool

The agent gets a `memory` tool it can call proactively:

| Action | Target | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `add` | `memory` or `user` | Append a new entry |
| `replace` | `memory` or `user` | Update an existing entry (matched by substring) |
| `remove` | `memory` or `user` | Delete an entry (matched by substring) |

### The `skill` Tool

The agent also gets a `skill` tool for saving reusable procedures:

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `create` | Save a new skill (name, description, step-by-step body) |
| `view` | Read a skill's full content, or list all skills if no name given |
| `patch` | Update one section of an existing skill (e.g., just the Procedure section) |
| `edit` | Replace the description and/or full body of a skill |
| `delete` | Remove a skill |

Skills are stored as `SKILL.md` files in `~/.pi/agent/memory/skills/`. Each has a structured body:

description: Step-by-step approach to debugging TS errors in monorepos
version: 1
created: 2026-04-26
updated: 2026-04-26
---
## When to Use
When you see TypeScript compilation errors, especially in monorepo setups.

## Procedure
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check tsconfig.json extends chain
3. Run tsc --noEmit to get full error list
4. Fix errors bottom-up (dependencies first)

## Pitfalls
- Don't trust VSCode's error display — use the CLI

## Verification
Run `tsc --noEmit` and confirm zero errors.
```

### Memory vs User Profile vs Skills

| Store | File | What goes here | Limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **memory** | `MEMORY.md` | Agent's notes — env facts, project conventions, tool quirks, lessons learned | 5,000 chars |
| **user** | `USER.md` | User profile — name, preferences, communication style, habits | 5,000 chars |
| **skills** | `skills/*.md` | Procedures — *how* to debug, deploy, test, or fix something | Unlimited |
| **extended** | `sessions.db` | Searchable memories beyond the core limit | Unlimited |
| **sessions** | `sessions.db` | Past conversation history (searchable via FTS5) | Unlimited |

### Session History Search

The extension indexes your Pi session history into a SQLite database with FTS5 full-text search. The agent can search across all past conversations using the `session_search` tool:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `session_search` | Search past conversations — "what did we discuss about auth?" |
| `memory_search` | Search extended memory store — unlimited capacity, keyword-based |

Session history is indexed automatically on session shutdown. To bulk-import existing sessions:

```
/memory-index-sessions
```

### Extended Memory Store

When the core memory (5,000 chars) isn't enough, the agent can store additional memories in the SQLite-backed extended store. These are searchable via `memory_search` but not automatically injected into the system prompt.

This is the **hybrid memory architecture**:
- **Core memory** (MEMORY.md/USER.md): Always injected, 5,000 chars each, human-readable
- **Extended memory** (SQLite): Unlimited, searchable on demand, agent-driven

### Correction Detection

When you correct the agent, it saves immediately — no waiting for the background review. Examples of corrections the agent detects:

| You say | What happens |
|---|---|
| "don't do that" | ✅ Immediate save |
| "no, use yarn instead" | ✅ Immediate save |
| "actually, fix the test first" | ✅ Immediate save |
| "I said use pnpm" | ✅ Immediate save |
| "no worries" | ❌ Not a correction — ignored |
| "actually looks great" | ❌ Not a correction — ignored |

### Auto-Consolidation

When memory or user profile hits its character limit, the extension automatically consolidates instead of returning an error:

1. Spawns a one-shot `pi.exec()` process with a consolidation prompt
2. The child agent merges related entries, removes outdated ones, keeps the most important facts
3. Parent reloads from disk and retries the original save
4. If consolidation fails, falls back to the original error

You can also trigger this manually with `/memory-consolidate`.

### Tool-Call-Aware Review

Background review triggers based on **activity level**, not just turn count:

- **Every 10 turns** — the default nudge interval
- **OR every 15 tool calls** — catches complex tasks that involve many reads/edits/bash calls

Both counters reset after each review.

### Skill Auto-Extraction

After a complex task (8+ tool calls using 2+ different tools in a single turn), the extension automatically asks the agent:

> "This was a complex task — should we save a reusable procedure?"

This means skills build up naturally over time without you having to ask.

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/memory-insights` | Shows everything stored in memory and user profile |
| `/memory-skills` | Lists all agent-created skills |
| `/memory-consolidate` | Manually trigger memory consolidation to free space |
| `/memory-interview` | Answer a few questions to pre-fill your user profile |
| `/memory-switch-project` | List all project memories and their entry counts |
| `/memory-index-sessions` | Import past Pi sessions into the search database |
| `/learn-memory-tool` | Skill that teaches users how to use the memory system |

## Configuration

Create `~/.pi/agent/hermes-memory-config.json`:

```json
{
  "memoryCharLimit": 5000,
  "userCharLimit": 5000,
  "projectCharLimit": 5000,
  "memoryDir": "~/.pi/agent/memory",
  "nudgeInterval": 10,
  "nudgeToolCalls": 15,
  "reviewEnabled": true,
  "autoConsolidate": true,
  "correctionDetection": true,
  "failureInjectionEnabled": true,
  "failureInjectionMaxAgeDays": 7,
  "failureInjectionMaxEntries": 5,
  "flushOnCompact": true,
  "flushOnShutdown": true,
  "flushMinTurns": 6
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `memoryCharLimit` | `5000` | Max characters in MEMORY.md |
| `userCharLimit` | `5000` | Max characters in USER.md |
| `projectCharLimit` | `5000` | Max characters in project-scoped MEMORY.md |
| `memoryDir` | `~/.pi/agent/memory` | Custom directory for memory files |
| `nudgeInterval` | `10` | Turns between auto-reviews |
| `nudgeToolCalls` | `15` | Tool calls between auto-reviews (OR with turns) |
| `reviewEnabled` | `true` | Enable/disable background learning loop |
| `autoConsolidate` | `true` | Auto-merge when memory hits capacity |
| `correctionDetection` | `true` | Detect user corrections and save immediately |
| `failureInjectionEnabled` | `true` | Enable/disable injecting recent failure memories into the system prompt |
| `failureInjectionMaxAgeDays` | `7` | Maximum age in days for injected failure memories |
| `failureInjectionMaxEntries` | `5` | Maximum number of failure memories to inject |
| `flushOnCompact` | `true` | Flush memories before Pi compacts context |
| `flushOnShutdown` | `true` | Flush memories when session ends |
| `flushMinTurns` | `6` | Minimum turns before flush triggers |
| `autoInject` | `true` | Inject memory into system prompt on every session start |
| `sessionSearchEnabled` | `true` | Enable session history search via SQLite FTS5 |
| `sessionRetentionDays` | `90` | Days to retain session history |

### Config via `settings.json`

You can also put config under the `hermesMemory` key in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (highest priority) or project-local `.pi/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hermesMemory": {
    "autoInject": false,
    "memoryCharLimit": 3000
  }
}
```

Settings cascade: `settings.json` → `hermes-memory-config.json` → built-in defaults.

## Where Data Lives

```
~/.pi/agent/memory/
├── MEMORY.md          ← Agent's personal notes (env facts, patterns, lessons)
├── USER.md            ← User profile (name, preferences, habits)
├── sessions.db        ← SQLite database (session history + extended memory)
└── skills/
    ├── debug-typescript-errors.md
    └── deploy-checklist.md
```

These are plain markdown files. You can read and edit them directly if you want to curate what the agent remembers. Memory entries are separated by `§` (section sign). Skills use standard SKILL.md format with frontmatter.

The `sessions.db` SQLite database stores session history and extended memory entries. It's searchable via FTS5 full-text search.

## Known Limitations

- **`§` delimiter**: Memory entries are separated by `§` (section sign). If an entry naturally contains `§`, it will be split incorrectly on reload. This is rare in English text but possible. [Hermes uses the same delimiter.]
- **Background review cost**: Each review cycle costs one full LLM API call via a child `pi -p` process. Correction detection and skill auto-extraction add occasional extra calls.
- **Session search requires indexing**: Past sessions must be indexed before they're searchable. Run `/memory-index-sessions` to bulk-import, or let the extension auto-index on session shutdown.
- **System prompts are invisible**: Pi's TUI does not display the system prompt. Memory injection works but you won't see it in the interface — verify by asking the agent a question that relies on stored memory.
- **Skills are agent-generated**: Skills are created by the agent based on its experience. They may not always be perfectly structured. You can edit or delete them in `~/.pi/agent/memory/skills/`.
